1).Research and provide three real-world applications where C programming is extensively used, such as in embedded systems, operating systems, or game development.

=>C programming is a foundational language that is  used in  real-world applications due to its  performance, and low-level capabilities.

1. Embedded Systems
=>Example Applications: Microcontrollers
=>C is popular in  systems because it provides low-level access to hardware, allowing  manipulation of memory and system resources.
=>Real-World Example: Automotive control systems for managing engine functions, sensors, and displays in modern cars.

2. Operating Systems
=>Example Applications: Linux, Windows kernel.
=>Operating systems require direct access to the hardware and  memory management, which is facilitated by C's low-level programming features.
Real-World Example: Linux kernel, which is  provides a powerful open-source operating system that is used in a variety of devices, from smartphone.
3. Game Development
=>Example Applications: Game engines, high-performance 3D graphics.
=>C allows for the development of resource  applications, such as 3D graphics engines.
=>Real-World Example: The development of the original game engines like the many console games that require a high level of performance.


2).Install a C compiler on your system and configure the IDE. Write your first program to print "Hello, World!" and run it.

=>Install a C Compiler :
•	Download and install MinGW to get the GCC compiler.
•	Go to the MinGW website and download.
•	After installation, add the bin folder (e.g., C:\MinGW\bin) to your System PATH:
o	Right-click on This PC  → Properties → Advanced system settings → Environment Variables.
o	Under System Variables, find Path and click Edit.
o	Add C:\MinGW\bin to the path list, then click OK.

=> Write your first program to print "Hello, World!"
=>#include <stdio.h>
int main()
 {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}

Output:= Hello, World!
